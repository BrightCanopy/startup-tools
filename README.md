# startup-tools
A list of companies and products that provide products and services specifically useful to startups and bootstrappers. This is a replacement for the "Cool Tools" folder in my browser bookmarks. I'll continue to migrate things in. Eventually this should be a long list. What other information should we be tracking for each? I'm hoping with collaboration, I'll learn of many I've never heard of before.
